## Project Description:
For our final project, we wanted to direct our focus to the topic of urban development and its relation to crime, specifically the distribution of crime incidents in the City of Seattle and their proximity to public green spaces. Our goal was to create an interactive web map that allows the user to hover throughout the city and across scales to better understand the relationship between crime and green urban spaces. By highlighting areas of currently existing public green spaces (Volunteer Park, Ravenna Park, Golden Gardens , etc.) and incorporating features such as a heat map and a bounding box function, we hope to provide the basis for a more comprehensive study of urban planning and the role that these public spaces have on the population and neighborhoods.


## Project Objectives:
The objective of the project is to better describe and observe the effect that public green spaces have on the distribution and type of criminal activity in urban spaces. Whether green spaces become hotspots of criminal activity or rather alleviate neighborhoods from such. The project takes into account the complexity of the phenomenon of crime, so rather than trying to provide an all-encompassing explanation for such, we will try to further develop the discourse by providing a more nuanced approach; taking into account public recreational space. By analyzing how these public spaces can play into crime in the Seattle area, we aim to find correlations that can reduce the harm caused by crimes, especially violent ones. If a greater amount of publicly accessible green spaces results in a smaller amount of crime in that area, it becomes clear that there needs to be a prioritization of developing these types of spaces, especially in the more crime ridden areas of Seattle.
